# Admin interface
#

For the longer term, I'm also interested in developing an admin interface to the
  milestones tables, which would allow me to add new milestones items, or images, references, ... For security, this
  would have to be in a separate, private GitHub repo. There is already a phpMyAdmin application for the datavis.ca
  site at http://datavis.ca/datavis_db_admin/, but it is password protected, and doesn't provide a simple interface
  for adding/editing items.  I can try to give you access to this if necessary.
