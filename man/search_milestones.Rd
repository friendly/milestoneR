\title{Search milestones by text pattern}
\usage{
search_milestones(
  pattern,
  fields = c("description", "tag", "note"),
  output = c("mid", "print", "data"),
  ignore.case = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{Character string or regular expression to search for}

\item{fields}{Character vector of field names to search. Default is
c("description", "tag", "note"). Other searchable fields include:
"slug", "date_from", "date_to", "location", "extra".}

\item{output}{Output format: "mid" returns a numeric vector of milestone IDs,
"print" prints formatted milestones and returns them invisibly,
"data" returns the matching milestone data frame rows.
Default is "mid".}

\item{ignore.case}{Logical; if TRUE (default), case is ignored during matching}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{print_milestone}} when
output = "print"}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{output}:
  \itemize{
    \item "mid": Numeric vector of matching milestone IDs
    \item "print": Character vector of formatted milestones (invisibly),
          with formatted output printed to console
    \item "data": Data frame of matching milestone rows
  }
}
\description{
Search for milestones matching a text pattern (regular expression) across
specified fields in the milestone table.
}
\details{
The function searches for the pattern across all specified fields using
regular expression matching. A milestone is included in the results if the
pattern matches in ANY of the specified fields (OR logic).

The \code{pattern} argument accepts regular expressions, allowing for
flexible searching:
\itemize{
  \item Simple text: "contour" finds "contour map", "contours", etc.
  \item Multiple terms: "chart|graph" finds either term
  \item Word boundaries: "\\\\bmap\\\\b" finds "map" but not "bitmap"
  \item Case patterns: "[Cc]artograph" finds "cartograph" or "Cartograph"
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Find milestones mentioning "statistical"
search_milestones("statistical")

# Search in specific fields
search_milestones("Halley", fields = c("description", "note"))

# Use regex to find chart OR graph
search_milestones("chart|graph", fields = "description")

# Get and print formatted results
search_milestones("contour", output = "print")

# Get full data frame of matches
results <- search_milestones("visualization", output = "data")

# Search tags for specific terms
search_milestones("^1st", fields = "tag")

# Case-sensitive search
search_milestones("Map", ignore.case = FALSE)
}
